1. Implement an interface for shape, and derive circle, triangle, rectangle, square as children.  
Overload all three comparison operators to compare the shapes based on their area  
  - If equal then their perimeter should be considered. Only, and if only both are area and perimeter are equal then the objects should be considered equal.  
  - If you want, simplify pi as 3
2. Identify the abstract objects from yesterday’s assignment and implement interfaces for them 
  - update the code with today’s lecture topics.
