1. A car service shop needs to keep track of the records of services they provide to their customers.  
  Create a system for them so they could keep ATLEAST the below records:
  - Date the customer visited
  - Services performed (at least 2 different services)
  - Parts changed (at least 2 different parts)
  - Payment (method & amount)  
**NOTE** The purpose is to practice OO concepts we learnt – don’t focus on features, put your time on defining objects.
2. Bonus:  
  Update your linked-list(from Lecture 2) so you can use it as storage in assignment 1.
